        <p class="split-right"> Building on the <span class="p"><a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/dell-research-harvard/newswire">Newswire dataset</a></span> from Dell Research @ Harvard, our team of three studied the change of newswire activity across article topics and decades, and how it relates to the polarization of that topic in the United States. We explored a dataset on newspaper articles, including newspapers and their wire sources. We constructed homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs and apply Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures to generate rich embeddings that can capture newspaper similarity. We then classified the embeddings based on their political leaning and applied clustering methods to examine how newspaper clusters form based on ideology. Lastly, we conducted an ablation analysis of each of our methods, to generate meaningful insights about the effectiveness of different approaches in graphically modeling newspapers. </p>

          <ul>
            üíª <b>85</b> survey responses <br>
            üìù <b>3</b> interviews <br>
            üìï <b>4</b> literature reviews

            ‚è∞ <b>34.9%</b> Time/busy schedules 
          </ul>

        <p>      
            Because our original design question was aimed at connecting parents and families, we surveyed 85 parents with at least one child under the age of 18. 
            <strong>Overall, we found a strong general desire to improve connections with neighbors</strong>, and that major contributors
            to a lack of neighborhood social cohesion were COVID-19, lack of time or scheduling  conflicts, and shyness or anxiety.
            We also found no user interest in parent-specific tools: feedback from user interview subjects unanimously suggested lack of interest
            in knowing their childrens' friends' parents and limited desire to know other parents <em>as parents</em> in general. In the end, we
            decided to <strong>move away from solely parents toward neighbors in general</strong>, but our primary persona still allowed for interactions between parent and child.

        <h1> 3. Personas </h1>

        <p> We initially conceived of several (read: too many!) personas to fit different user types: a user in her 20s new to the neighborhood, a working mother of two, a retiree looking
          to "give back" locally... but eventually we conflated two personas to focus on our primary one: Triana Transplant. Triana is a working parent in a 2-parent household with a 9-year-old daughter; although 
          she is trying to spend quality time with her family and get to know people around her neighborhood, she <strong>doesn't have time to try out new activities on a whim</strong> and needs opportunities
          that <strong>accommodate her busy schedule</strong>.</p>

        <h2> <span class="underline">  Our design goals </span> </h2>
          <ul>    
            <li> Promote engagement </li>

            <li> Allow asynchronicity </li>
            <li> Invite all ages </li>
          </ul>      

        <h2> <span class="underline"> Concept decision </span> </h2>
        <p>
          After several rounds of ideation and narrowing down our design goals, we decided to work on a hybrid AR and mobile platform tentatively
          titled Cast/Tag. <strong>Our platform idea aimed to help users share 3D experiences with neighbors and form genuine connections around common needs or interests</strong>,
          using GPS tags and AR-enabled Smart Glasses to "tag" 3D assets in physical locations.

        <h1> 4. Storyboarding </h1>
        <p>My teammates helped me devise storyline ideas that I then illustrated in Procreate. While we encountered limitations in prototyping all of them (mainly time-based, in a 10-week course!),
        we managed to create a testable prototype of our first interaction. The idea was to allow users to explore "item drops" left by others in either their
        neighborhood or any vicinity and contribute to the AR piece they find with assets chosen from their personal inventory. Users can then further communicate with neighbors through AR and establish a rapport
        over any shared interests.</p>

        <h1> 5. Usability testing </h1>
        <p>We tested our lo-fi prototype with 5 different users.</p> 
        <h2> <span class="underline">  Process </span> </h2>
        <p> <strong>Users were tasked with:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li> Finding a new item drop near them </li>
          <li> Adding an asset to the item they found </li>
          <li> Adding the asset creator as a "neighbor" and sending a quick hello message </li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <h2> <span class="underline">  Findings </span> </h2>
        <p> <strong> While testing, we discovered that users struggled unanimously with: </strong>
        <ol>
          <li> Poor discoverability within the map (map size/difficulty locating how to start a route)
          <li> Having low to desire to actually "start" a route (i.e., wanting an organic wandering experience)
          <li> A need for greater transparency from actions in the profile screen
          <li> The "inventory" feature lacking comprehensibility
          </ol>

        After collecting testing data and user recommendations, we decided to <strong>strengthen the "past creations" design, clarify neighbor profiles,
          and add an onboarding screen to introduce users to the map view.</strong>
